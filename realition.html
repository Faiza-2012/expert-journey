<h1 class="introduction" style=" font-size: 18px; color: rgb(167, 167, 167);">Relationships are complicated whether they are romantic, friendly, or between siblings. In every way, they are complex, and most people struggle to understand them. For example, imagine that you are friends with someone and you have a fight or disagreement. You start to question if they are truly your friend. Are they even a real friend?

But then, your mind plays a little game. It starts signaling that your friend isn’t real or trustworthy. Meanwhile, your heart steps in and reminds you of the good moments you shared. If your heart wins, you begin to understand the value of your friend. If your mind wins — boom — you get frustrated and might even end the friendship.

This happens in every kind of relationship, but it depends on how deeply you feel for the person. The deeper the feelings, the harder the game.

Above all, we must understand that in any relationship — whether romantic or platonic — the other person also has feelings. They are human too, and humans make mistakes. As much as we need to stand up for ourselves, we also need the power of forgiveness.</h1>
