    Yes, a lot of people including myself search about mental health issues. Nowadays, it has sadly become a common problem. Many people struggle with various mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and more.

However, when someone tries to get the help they need, society often judges them. People say things like, 'Oh, you're going to a therapist? You must be crazy, mad, insane, or foolish.' These harmful words can discourage people from getting support.

As a result, those who are suffering may pretend to be happy or act like someone they're not, just to fit in. Even if they are breaking inside, they hide their real emotions because they're afraid of being labeled negatively.

This is why many people seek help online. Even if my website can't help you personally, it can at least answer commonly asked questions and highlight the reasons why people search for help in the first place.
