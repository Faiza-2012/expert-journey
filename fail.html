    Failure" is a word many people use. It’s when someone feels they can’t do something and they think that means they’ve failed. But no, it’s not.

For example, imagine you get 16 out of 25 on an exam. The passing mark is 12. You might still feel like you failed. But you didn’t because you passed, and not just passed, you scored even better than required.

There are moments when we want more than what we already have. It’s human nature to always want more. Wanting more is not the problem. The problem is thinking we’ve failed just because we didn’t get everything we wanted.

Do we get to eat every day? Do we have a roof over our heads to sleep under at night? Do we have clothes to wear every day? If yes, then we are already successful — because we have all our basic needs.

There is no such word as “failure” in life. Some people are more successful, and some are less successful — but no one is truly a failure.
