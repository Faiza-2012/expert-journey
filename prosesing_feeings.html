    Processing feelings is one of the hardest parts of every person’s life. It’s something that can cause mental breakdowns. It's the kind of thing that changes a person.

There’s a saying: 'People also change with time.' But has anyone ever tried to understand why they change? No, most people don’t. The truth is, as people grow up, their feelings get more complicated. They start to understand things — sometimes things that are hard to accept.

When people can’t handle reality, their emotions become even more confusing. This can also be the starting point of anger issues. When someone struggles to process their feelings, they get frustrated over small things and may suddenly burst out.

People change because of how they process feelings — or because they can’t. When someone loses the ability to truly understand their emotions, they change while trying to figure themselves out. And even when they can process it, they still change — because of the weight and depth of what they realize.
